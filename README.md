# PFE-Density-Estimation-using-Normalizing-Flows

As part of our capstone project. I completed a study on Normalizing Flow and its applications with two other classmates.

Some examples of Normalizing flows using the Real NVP model may be found in this project:
- A point cloud restoration demonstration in the file Half Moon RealNVP.pyÂ 
- A MNIST database application in the file MNIST RealNVP.py
- In the folder NVPdensityMultivariate.py, there are an examples of reconstruction from gaussian distributions. Firstly in 1 dimension in the file "Mixture_CDF_Gaussians.py", there are two construction with a mixture of 1 or 2 gaussians.
