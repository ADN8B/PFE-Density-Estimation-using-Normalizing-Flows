# PFE-Density-Estimation-using-Normalizing-Flows

As part of our capstone project. I completed a study on Normalizing Flow and its applications with two other classmates.

Many examples of Noramlizing flow using the Real NVP model may be found in this project:
- A point cloud restoration demonstration in the file Half Moon RealNVP.pyÂ 
- A MNIST database application in the file MNIST RealNVP.py
- In the file Mixture CDF Gaussians.py, there is an example of reconstruction from gaussian distributions.
